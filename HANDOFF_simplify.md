# Handoff — PR #41 simplification (branch `refactor/simplify-pr41`)

Branch tip `2913a58` (== `xuefei/refactor/simplify-pr41`). All non-judgment
cleanup is **done, verified, and pushed**. Only the TODO D judgment items
remain (they need explicit sign-off, not a blind refactor).

## Completed

Earlier passes (pre-reconciliation):

1. `refactor: remove dead code and dedup checkpoint warm-start loop`
   — dead `extract_archive`, dead config constants, dead `_build_centroid_tree`
   / `_idx2marker`, and the 3× checkpoint warm-start loop deduped into
   `deepcell_types/training/utils.py::load_matching_state_dict`.
2. `refactor(config): drop config members unused anywhere in the repo`.
3. `refactor(training): split dataset god-file into focused modules`
   — `training/dataset.py` 1875 → 884 lines; extracted `transforms.py`,
   `samplers.py`, `splits.py`, `dataloader.py`; `dataset.py` re-exports every
   symbol so the public import surface is unchanged.

Parallel branch reconciliation (`refactor/simplify-pr41-tasks34` folded in via
cherry-pick — new SHAs, so that branch is now safe to delete):

- `afcb10b` fix: update pretrain.py model unpack arity after tumor_logit removal
- `31aeff3` refactor: hardcode cls_residual mean-intensity mode, remove
  `mean_intensity_mode` parameter
- `a83c077` refactor: remove ct_exclude and tissue-filter inference API

Final three handoff tasks (this session):

- **TODO C — `730b421`** `**kwargs` → explicit params in `CellTypeAnnotator.__init__`
  and `create_model`. Promoted `spatial_pool_size`, `resnet_base_channels`,
  `compat_marker0_zero`, `n_celltypes`, `n_domains` to explicit keyword params with
  unchanged defaults; dropped `**kwargs`. (`mean_intensity_mode` was already removed
  by `31aeff3`.) `compat_marker0_zero=True` preserved for v0.1.0 checkpoint parity.
- **TODO B — `5058b2c`** `CellTypeAnnotator.forward()` now returns a fixed-arity
  `AnnotatorOutput` NamedTuple; `cls_to_channels` is `Optional` (None unless
  `return_attn_weights=True`) instead of a length-varying tuple. Call sites read by
  name; the `save_attention` if/else in `scripts/predict.py` collapsed to one unpack.
- **TODO A — `2913a58`** extracted `LazyMarkerPositivityDict` → `training/embeddings.py`
  and `CELL_TYPE_HIERARCHY` → `training/hierarchy.py`; `config.py` re-exports both
  (815 → 701 lines). `LazyMarkerPositivityDict.__setstate__` imports `TissueNetConfig`
  lazily to avoid a circular import; verified with a pickle round-trip.
  `TissueNetConfig` itself was kept intact per the original plan.

Each of C/B/A was verified `ruff` clean and `227 passed / 4 skipped` before commit.

## Verification recipe (IMPORTANT — train-extra env required)

The repo's inference-only `.venv` silently **skips 16 of 25 test files** (the
`[train]`-extra ones gated by `tests/conftest.py::collect_ignore` when
`zarr`/`pandas`/`torchmetrics` are missing) — that collapses the suite from
~227 to ~53 and hides any regression in training code. Use a train-equipped
interpreter and point `PYTHONPATH` at the worktree:

```bash
PY=/data/xwang3/Projects/dct-baseline-migration/.venv/bin/python   # has zarr/pandas/torchmetrics
WT=<this worktree root>
ruff check deepcell_types scripts                 # must be "All checks passed!"
PYTHONPATH=$WT $PY -m pytest tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider   # baseline: 227 passed / 4 skipped
```

(The editable-install meta-path finder *appends* to `sys.meta_path`, so a
`PYTHONPATH` entry shadows it and the worktree's code wins.)

## Method contract (applies to every task below)

- **Behavior-preserving.** No change to model numerics, RNG, tensor math,
  normalization, scatter/gather, file formats, or published-checkpoint outputs.
- **Verify each task green before committing** against the train-extra env above;
  pass/skip counts must match the `227 passed / 4 skipped` baseline.
- **Edit via Bash (python str.replace with count assertions) for existing
  files** — there is a PostToolUse formatter hook on Edit/Write that reflows
  whole files and creates huge noisy diffs. Brand-new files via Write are fine.
- **No force-push.** Push fast-forward only; if rejected, fetch + rebase, and if
  the rebase conflicts, abort and reconcile manually.

## TODO D — behavior-changing / judgment items (need explicit sign-off)

These are intentionally NOT done because they change behavior or public surface.
Each needs a human decision, not a blind refactor.

1. **Unify the two preprocessing percentile paths.**
   `deepcell_types/preprocessing.py` has `_percentile_threshold` (NaN-percentile,
   used by `preprocess_fov`) AND `_percentile_threshold_nonzero` (nonzero-indexing,
   used by the legacy `patch_generator` that the published checkpoint was trained
   against). They are deliberately NOT unified — the inference path must stay
   bit-compatible with the trained checkpoint. **Do not merge without retraining.**
   See the comment block above `_normalize_per_channel` in `preprocessing.py`.

2. **Shadowed module-name pairs** — `config.py`/`training/config.py`,
   `dataset.py`/`training/dataset.py`, `abstention.py`/`training/abstention.py`.
   These are an INTENTIONAL inference-vs-training dependency split (keeps the
   inference path numpy-only, no `[train]` extras). Renaming would break public
   import paths and the baselines. **Recommendation: leave as-is.** Filename-only
   navigation hazard; the classes are uniquely named (DCTConfig vs
   TissueNetConfig, PatchDataset vs FullImageDataset).

3. **Remaining public-looking but in-repo-unused config members.** Some
   `TissueNetConfig` members are unused within this repo but read like a stable
   public API external notebooks may depend on. Removing them is a public-API
   break — get sign-off and a deprecation cycle rather than deleting outright.

4. **`forward()` still returns several heads** (domain_logits, marker_pos_logits,
   cls_embedding, channel_outputs) that not all callers use. Trimming the return
   is a behavior/contract change (training needs them; inference doesn't) — only
   do this with a clear caller audit. Now that TODO B made the output a named
   `AnnotatorOutput`, an unused head can be dropped by name with less risk, but it
   is still a public-contract change.
