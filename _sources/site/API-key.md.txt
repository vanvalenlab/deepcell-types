API Key Usage
-------------

The token that is issued by <https://users.deepcell.org> should be added as an
environment variable:

```bash
export DEEPCELL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token-from-users.deepcell.org>
```

This line can be added to your shell configuration (e.g. ``.bashrc``, ``.zshrc``,
``.bash_profile``, etc.) to automatically grant access to DeepCell models/data
upon login.

Models
------

The model can be downloaded for local use:

```python
>>> from deepcell_types.utils import download_model

>>> download_model()
```

A `version` can be specified to access a specific pre-trained model, e.g.

```python
download_model(version="2025-06-09_public-data-only")
```

A listing of available pre-trained models is available at
`deepcell_types.utils._model_registry`.

Training Data
-------------

```{warning}
The training dataset is over 1.3 TB - make sure you have space and sufficient
network bandwidth before attempting to download.
```

Similarly, training data can be downloaded for local use with:

```python
>>> from utils import download_training_data


>>> download_training_data()
```
